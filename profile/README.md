## Currenari

Currenari, also referred to as Currenari Lab, is an independent electronics lab focused on designing, building, and documenting embedded electronic systems.

The work centres on complete reference builds. Projects are developed end to end, from early prototyping through to finished hardware and firmware, and are published once they reach a stable working state.
